Respected sir/ma'am,


		=> I watch php GET and Post methods videos and do basic practices according to them.
		     GET= It's Values is visible in the URL.
	                             =It's can be book marked due to the visibility of the values in the URL
		            =It Supports only string data.
		   POST=It's Values is not visible in the URL
                                              =It's cannot be book marked
                                              =It Supports many differnet data type String,Numeric etc. 
		=>And I practice one form with use of this Get And Post methode.
		=>And Push them in Git repo.
